USB4RT is in kind of a dormant state right now. The most urging issues are
 - known but still unfixed issues doing bulk transfer (IIRC, see also
   [1]), no one yet understood what goes wrong inside the stack
 - lacking USB 2.0 (EHCI) support
 - lacking proper abstraction layer to base high-level USB drivers (like
   eth-over-usb) on top it, something RTDM-based was once considered but
   is still looking for someone to work on.

But at least the current stack still compiles against latest Xenomai and
Linux 2.6.27 - just checked :).

Well, all these things are no black magic or blocked by fundamental
design issues. This project is just lacking resources to address them.
If you are willing to contribute even only to parts of that topics, you
would be very welcome and I would try my best to support you, at the
bare minimum by merging patches.

The good news these days is that debugging the stack should become much
easier: KVM (or plain QEMU if you are lacking hw support) talks USB up
to 2.0 now. You can either debug the stack at hw emulation level (ie.
look into the USB model of QEMU to see the state the hardware is in) or
debug the kernel and modules via the built-in gdbserver at system level.
One could even imagine to write simple USB device models for test
purposes, stressing specific (problematic...) USB modes without having
to provide real hardware. That should accelerate development and test
cycles a lot. Sigh, if there were just a bit more time...
