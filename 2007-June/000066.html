<PRE>As always, thanks for you quick reply Jan.

And it turns out, you are right: isochronous transfers and interrupt
transfers are not supported yet by USB4RT.
However, if I am not mistaken, according to the USB specs, a bulk transfer
and an interrupt transfer are not much different.
So I was able to poll the relative X and Y mouse displacements with bulk
calls with a INTERRUPT receiving pipe (i.e. usb_rcvintpipe). In other words,
I do the same thing as with a bulk transfer (see rt_usb_core.c), except I do
it over an interrupt pipe.

Of course, because it is not meant to be used that way, if the mouse is
polled when it's not moving or if it is polled faster than its internal
refresh, calls to rt_usb_submit_urb might return EBUSY errors. All I do for
the moment is ignore these EBUSY errors when they occur. Actually, if the
polling frequency is matched to the mouse internal refresh rate, there is
never any problem because everything is in synch and the EBUY errors don't
even show up.

I am aware that none of the above is probably very clean, but I thought I
would still post it here if anyone needs to poll the relative displacements
of a standard mouse as I do.

cheers

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I apologize for how messy my code must look. For now I just wanted to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I put together the following non-blocking call. But the callback

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rt_callback_fkt is never handled... In other words, nothing happens.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dmesg doesn't seem to report any problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
