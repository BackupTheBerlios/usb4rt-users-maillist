Hello,

I want to build usb4rt with xenomai.
I have tried it and follow the following steps and found some error

./configure

./configure: line 19801: /usr/realtime/fusion/bin/rtai-config: No such file
or directory
configure: error: *** Cannot identify DESTDIR
rm: cannot remove `core': Is a directory


So,Please help me how to compile it with Xenomai.

Thanks & Regards,
Ilesh
