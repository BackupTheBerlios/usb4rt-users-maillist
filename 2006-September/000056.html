Ok, this looks like a common issue. I just asked the student who is
working on serial adapter driver here if he ever noticed problems with
bulk URBs &lt;= 64. I was sure he had spoken up if there were any. Answer:
&quot;Yes, this doesn't seem to work.&quot; Interesting. I think I have to teach
him to complain about such issues earlier. ;)

Time is limited, so I cannot promise when we can dig deeper into this.
Do you feel like stepping into the usb4rt core? There is a lot of debug
code contained and some parts are not as straight as they could be, but
the code should not be that hard to grasp. Maybe is is &quot;just&quot; comparing
the behaviour when sending small control vs. bulk URBs.

If yes, you could use the classic &quot;printk&quot; debugging or, alternatively,
via kgdb over serial console [1]. I just updated and fixed the latter
yesterday, so it works fine now over 2.6.17 + Xenomai 2.2.x.
