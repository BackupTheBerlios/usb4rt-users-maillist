</I>&gt;<i> Ok, this looks like a common issue. I just asked the student who is

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Yes, this doesn't seem to work.&quot; Interesting. I think I have to teach

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>hmmm! I feel a little better knowing that I wasn't doing anything wrong.
&gt;<i> Time is limited, so I cannot promise when we can dig deeper into this.
</I>&gt;<i> Do you feel like stepping into the usb4rt core? There is a lot of debug

</I>&gt;<i> the code should not be that hard to grasp. Maybe is is &quot;just&quot; comparing
</I>&gt;<i> the behaviour when sending small control vs. bulk URBs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I can certainly try to take a look at it. But no guarantees. I am not a 
very strong programmer. It's a nice challenge for me though.
In any case, I can also wait for you to have time to &quot;dig deeper&quot;.

&gt;<i> If yes, you could use the classic &quot;printk&quot; debugging or, alternatively,
</I>&gt;<i> via kgdb over serial console [1]. I just updated and fixed the latter
</I>&gt;<i> yesterday, so it works fine now over 2.6.17 + Xenomai 2.2.x.

</I>This should get me started as soon as I can get my hands on a null modem 
cable.

thanks a lot Jan
