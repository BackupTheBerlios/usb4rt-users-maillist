Title: CAN I TRUST YOU?
Dear Friend,




My Name is Mrs.Bakara Wachiri from Syria. The message you are about to read  
is a Pleasant surprise to you. A mixture of pain, anticipation and victory.



Firstly, I am married to Mr Fara Wachiri.A gold merchant who shared  
ownership of a small gold Mine in Burkina Faso. He died of Cardiovascular  
Disease before the uprising in Syria began in mid-March 2011. After his  
death, I was supposed to be registered by the company as a shareholder  
according to the provisions of the company's articles.However; there were  
conflicts and restrictions on transmission in the company's articles to  
approve my letter to be registered as a shareholder in the company.



Afterwards, there was a cross option agreement between me and the  
shareholders of the company for the sale and purchase of my deceased  
husband's shares, with valuation arrangements and perhaps time to pay. The  
sum of $ 7.200 million (Seven million two hundred thousand dollars) was  
paid to his existing account in a bank in Ouagadougou the capital city of  
Burkina Faso in West Africa, the actual location of the gold mine company.  
The payments were from the sale of the shares, death benefits payment and  
entitlements.




At the time of his illness, I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  
Presently, am partially suffering from a stroke illness. My doctor  
confidentially told me that i have less chance to live. Having known my  
health condition, I decided to give out the money to charity and the  
orphanage homes. But to achieve this purpose, the estate needs to pass over  
to an executor or administrator as part of my family legacy. I am unable to  
do this and this is why i am contacting you to claim the fund and act as an  
executor of my estate since none of my husband&#8217;s relation or mine are  
alive. They were killed in the war in my country Syria. My only son died on  
the15 of June, 2012.




If you accept my offer, you will take 30 % percent of the total money While  
70% of the money will go to charity and the orphanage homes. I will provide  
the names and contact information of charity organizations and orphanage  
homes to receive the donation.If this money remains unclaimed after my  
death, the bank executives or the government will take the money as  
unclaimed fund and maybe Use it for selfish and worthless ventures.



As soon as I receive your response I shall give you the contact of the bank  
in Burkina Faso for the claim.You must assure me that you will act  
accordingly as I stated above.I write to you through the assistance of a  
nurse in the hospital. Note that this task requires urgent action.



Yours hopefully,

Mrs.Bakara Wachiri.
