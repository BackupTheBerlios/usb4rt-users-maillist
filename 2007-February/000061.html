<PRE>Hi Jan,

After putting on the side for a few weeks my project that makes use of
usb4rt,  I am now coming back to it. Right before putting everything on the
back burner, I was trying to figure out 2 recurrent problems with usb4rt
under bulk transfer. One had to do with a weird restriction on the URB size
and the other one with a faulty read operation. These problems were somehow
- i.e. to the best of my capabilities - reported on this mailing list in
September 2006.  Unfortunately, I never succeeded in finding what was wrong,
even with all your helpful comments.

In your September 21st 2006 post, you mentioned that there was a student who
was working on a serial adapter driver. I was wondering if there was any
progress on your side? Either from him or from you. Especially with respect
to the two problems mentioned above.

I realize that usb4rt is not a high priority project and that you have
limited resources, but I was wondering if there are any plans in the near
future to try to fix these problems.

For now, there is a small change that I suggest making to the usb4rt trunk.
Xenomai's latest version,  2.3,  is not supported by usb4rt. Actually, I
suspect that it's only the build system of usb4rt that lacks the detection
of Xenomai 2.3 since there doesn't seem to be huge difference between
Xenomai 2.2 and 2.3. Am I right? If it's the case, could the usb4rt trunk be
updated accordingly? Thanks

Best regards
