</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Jan,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After putting on the side for a few weeks my project that makes use of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; usb4rt,  I am now coming back to it. Right before putting everything on
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; back burner, I was trying to figure out 2 recurrent problems with usb4rt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; under bulk transfer. One had to do with a weird restriction on the URB
</I>&gt;<i> size
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the other one with a faulty read operation. These problems were
</I>&gt;<i> somehow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - i.e. to the best of my capabilities - reported on this mailing list in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; September 2006.  Unfortunately, I never succeeded in finding what was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wrong,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even with all your helpful comments.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In your September 21st 2006 post, you mentioned that there was a student
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; who
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was working on a serial adapter driver. I was wondering if there was any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; progress on your side? Either from him or from you. Especially with
</I>&gt;<i> respect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the two problems mentioned above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Due to time constraints of his work, he was not able to dig deeper into
</I>&gt;<i> that issue, only to confirm it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I realize that usb4rt is not a high priority project and that you have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; limited resources, but I was wondering if there are any plans in the
</I>&gt;<i> near
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; future to try to fix these problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No concrete plans. We would love to have usb4rt working completely, but
</I>&gt;<i> the pain not having it is still not heavy enough to shift priorities.
</I>

Yep. I really understand what you need.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For now, there is a small change that I suggest making to the usb4rt
</I>&gt;<i> trunk.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Xenomai's latest version,  2.3,  is not supported by usb4rt. Actually, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suspect that it's only the build system of usb4rt that lacks the
</I>&gt;<i> detection
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of Xenomai 2.3 since there doesn't seem to be huge difference between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Xenomai 2.2 and 2.3. Am I right? If it's the case, could the usb4rt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trunk be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; updated accordingly? Thanks
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Build fix just applied, compiles fine against both 2.3 and trunk here. I
</I>&gt;<i> also added more archs to configure - before this becomes the next barrier.
</I>

thanks Jan.

Sorry, right now this is all I can do for you - without having to start
&gt;<i> diving deeeeep into USB low-level programming on my own. :(
</I>



How far did your examinations take you? I once thought about trying qemu
&gt;<i> with its USB emulation. Xenomai runs fine there (except /wrt temporal
</I>&gt;<i> determinism, of course), and we use it heavily for development. May this
</I>&gt;<i> would allow to attach a debugger and/or to snoop the USB traffic via the
</I>&gt;<i> host USB layer that qemu must use. Just another idea...
</I>



It's the same sad reality for all of us. Not enough time to do everything.
Argh....
Thankfully, the way things are set-up now, my program that makes use of
usb4rt seems to work regardless of the two problems above, but it's just
much slower than it should do. For instance, I need to go through 2 read
operations to get valid data every time I want to do a bulk read.
Eventually, I will need to figure out what is wrong in usb4rt because I want
to be able to run at full speed. For the moment, I will just try Jan's
suggestion(s) as soon as I have a moment. In the meantime, any other
suggestions from anyone are welcome, of course.

Thanks a lot for all your support Jan.

Cheers
