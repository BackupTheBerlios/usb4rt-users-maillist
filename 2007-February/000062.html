&gt;<i> Hi Jan,

</I>&gt;<i> After putting on the side for a few weeks my project that makes use of
</I>&gt;<i> usb4rt,  I am now coming back to it. Right before putting everything on the
</I>&gt;<i> back burner, I was trying to figure out 2 recurrent problems with usb4rt

</I>&gt;<i> September 2006.  Unfortunately, I never succeeded in finding what was
</I>&gt;<i> wrong,
</I>&gt;<i> even with all your helpful comments.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In your September 21st 2006 post, you mentioned that there was a student
</I>&gt;<i> who
</I>&gt;<i> was working on a serial adapter driver. I was wondering if there was any
</I>&gt;<i> progress on your side? Either from him or from you. Especially with respect
</I>&gt;<i> to the two problems mentioned above.
</I>
Due to time constraints of his work, he was not able to dig deeper into
that issue, only to confirm it.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I realize that usb4rt is not a high priority project and that you have
</I>&gt;<i> limited resources, but I was wondering if there are any plans in the near
</I>&gt;<i> future to try to fix these problems.
</I>
No concrete plans. We would love to have usb4rt working completely, but
the pain not having it is still not heavy enough to shift priorities.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For now, there is a small change that I suggest making to the usb4rt trunk.
</I>&gt;<i> Xenomai's latest version,  2.3,  is not supported by usb4rt. Actually, I
</I>&gt;<i> suspect that it's only the build system of usb4rt that lacks the detection
</I>&gt;<i> of Xenomai 2.3 since there doesn't seem to be huge difference between
</I>&gt;<i> Xenomai 2.2 and 2.3. Am I right? If it's the case, could the usb4rt
</I>&gt;<i> trunk be
</I>&gt;<i> updated accordingly? Thanks
</I>
Build fix just applied, compiles fine against both 2.3 and trunk here. I
also added more archs to configure - before this becomes the next barrier.

Sorry, right now this is all I can do for you - without having to start
diving deeeeep into USB low-level programming on my own. :(

How far did your examinations take you? I once thought about trying qemu
with its USB emulation. Xenomai runs fine there (except /wrt temporal
determinism, of course), and we use it heavily for development. May this
would allow to attach a debugger and/or to snoop the USB traffic via the
host USB layer that qemu must use. Just another idea...

Jan
